= iGrad

*Update me to describe iGrad*

== Notes

When moving from Mercurial to Git, there were two branches:

. `master` held changes made a while back by John Gibson. 
  Because performance was unacceptable, 
  this version was not in use in production.
. `old-igrad` was a branch from before the changes made by John.
  Ken had been using this branch in prodution for some while.

Ken had Tom rename these branches to better reflect reality.
